## Preface

FinderFox is a web browser implemented within the MacOS Finder application, rendering webpages by manipulating the .DS_store file to correctly position and layer files. FinderFox has 4 main features, a graphical renderer, a "retro" file/text based renderer, an integrated search engine, and a mathematical plotting mode.

This project was part of the **CamHack 2025** event, scoring in the top 10 projects and also winning the "Hackiest Hack" track prize.

>Within tight 2 day constraints for CamHack 2025, we created this product for the theme "Unintended Behaviour".
